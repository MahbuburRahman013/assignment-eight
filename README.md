## Search Functionality

Implement a search bar in the navbar that allows users to input categories to search for donations. When a category is entered into the search bar, clicking the search button will display only the donations that match the specified category on the homepage. This feature enhances the user experience by allowing them to quickly find donations of interest.

## Responsive Design

Ensure that the website is responsive and functions well on all devices, including desktop, mobile, and tablet views. Implement a responsive layout that adjusts the content and design elements to fit various screen sizes. This feature is crucial for providing a seamless user experience across different devices and screen resolutions.

## Multiple Donations

Users can make multiple donations at a time. The statistics page includes a pie chart that visually represents the total donations made and the remaining donations. This allows users to track their contributions effectively.
